#Advanced Java Final Project

This is the code for my AWS Project hosted on AWS Lambda using API Gateway and Amazon RDS.
The endpoints for adding address book entries are the following:

  Add through form - https://gdfvighdi8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v2/
  Add from file - https://gdfvighdi8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v2/uploader
  Search Database - https://gdfvighdi8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v2/search


***NOTE You may have to load the endpoint a few times at first as I'm using the free tier so access isn't immediate
